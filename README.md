# üçù CopyPasta ‚Äì serve your code al dente

CopyPasta lets you bundle multiple files or whole folders into a clean, AI-friendly paste.
It adds file banners, optional comment stripping, secret masking, and token-aware chunking ‚Äî so your project context is always ready to feed your favorite AI or share in reviews.

## ‚ú® Features

- ### Copy with banners
  Copy selected files or folders with a banner per file:

```bash
=== FILE: src/main.dart | LINES:120 BYTES:3024 | LANG:dart ===
```

- ### AI Paste Mode
  - Optional strip comments (safe / keep-doc / none).
    -Automatic secret masking (API keys, JWTs, Firebase keys‚Ä¶).
  - Token-aware chunking: splits into PART 1/2/3 when too long.
  - Context header with project info, Git state, file table of contents.
- ### Copy tree
  Generate an ASCII directory tree for one or multiple folders.
- ### Explorer integration
  Right-click in VS Code‚Äôs file explorer to copy exactly what you‚Äôve selected (multi-select supported).

## üõ† Requirements

- VS Code 1.90+
- Node.js 18+ for building (if installing from source).
- No extra runtime dependencies ‚Äî works out of the box.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings (all under copyPasta.):

- defaultGlob: default file glob for AI Paste.

- stripMode: none | safe | keep-doc.
- maskSecrets: automatically mask secrets.

## üìö Example

Copying 3 Dart files into clipboard yields:

````bash === AI CONTEXT ===
Project: my-app | Git: branch=main head=abc123 clean
Langs: dart
Files: 3 | Lines: 482 | Bytes: 14923
BUNDLE-HASH: merkle-sha256: f19c3f2a1b7e8cda
=== END AI CONTEXT ===

=== FILE: lib/main.dart | LINES:120 BYTES:3024 | LANG:dart ===
```dart
// code‚Ä¶
=== END FILE ===
````

If too long, it automatically splits into PART 1/2/‚Ä¶ with clear markers.
